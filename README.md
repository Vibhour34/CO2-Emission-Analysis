# CO2 Emissions Analysis 🚗🌍

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is based on the **CO2 Emissions dataset (Canada)**.  
It contains detailed information about vehicles, including **Make, Model, Vehicle Class, Engine Size, Cylinders, Transmission, Fuel Type, Fuel Consumption, and CO2 Emissions**.  

The goal of this analysis is to explore the dataset, extract insights, and visualize trends that affect **fuel consumption and carbon emissions**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the dataset.  
- Identify relationships between **engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions**.  
- Highlight **environmental insights** that can guide policymakers and car manufacturers.  
- Visualize trends using **matplotlib & pandas**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** – Data analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Vehicles with **larger engine sizes and more cylinders** tend to emit **higher CO2**.  
- **Automatic transmissions** generally emit more CO2 compared to manual ones.  
- **Fuel type** strongly influences emissions (diesel vs petrol vs hybrid).  
- Better **fuel efficiency (mpg)** is linked with **lower CO2 emissions**.
